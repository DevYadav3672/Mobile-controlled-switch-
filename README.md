# Mobile-controlled-switch-
This switch board can controlled by your mobile phone from any point in the world.

PURPOSE TO BUILD THIS PROJECT :
- I am pursuing electronics and communication engineering degree from Govt. engineering college(Rajkot,Gujrat) that belongs from Gujrat technological university and I have made this project to Control actuators from online IOT apps, so if you want to learn how to Control actuators from Online IOT apps then this project will very helpful for learners.

UNIQUENESS OF THIS PROJECT :
- On the entire internet i have searched "How to use raw relay for smaller currents?" but there is 0.0001% of containt is available and that is not suffieciant to understand the core relay mechanism so from this project you can get that core knowledge about Raw relay.
